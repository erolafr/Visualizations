# Visualizations
Multiple and diverse visualizations. In this folder you'll find:

- [*CircularDendogram_BrotFunctionalTraits*](https://github.com/erolafr/Visualizations/tree/main/CircularDendogram_BrotFunctionalTraits): R script for building a **circular dendrogram** of the differences between plant Mediterranean species found at the public Database BROT (https://www.uv.es/jgpausas/brot.htm, published by Tavşanoğlu and Pausas 2018:https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018135) considering the three functional traits: Specific leaf area, seed mass and plant height. 
- [*ContourPlot_ClimaticNiche*](https://github.com/erolafr/Visualizations/tree/main/ContourPlot_ClimaticNiche): R script for building a **contour plot** of the climatic niche of the species Lantana camara (ocurrences from GBIF: https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/map?taxon_key=2925303) considering the bioclimatic variables annual mean temperature and anual precipitations from WordlClim (https://www.worldclim.org/data/bioclim.html)
- [*Timeline plot*](https://github.com/erolafr/Visualizations/tree/main/TimeLinePlot_UnsustainableFertilityByCountry): JPG created by Tableau to build a **Timeline plot** showing the first time that each country registered a value under 2.1 children/mother in its fertility rate (the demographic sustainable rate) since 1960 to 2020 by continent considering also its actual fertility rate. The data was obtained from: https://data.oecd.org/pop/fertility-rates.htm#indicator-chart and merged with region codes from: https://cloford.com/resources/codes/index.htm.
